# Opal-Ferro
Ferro is a small Ruby library on top of [Opal](http://opalrb.com/)
that enables an object-oriented programming style for creating code
that runs in the webbrowser.
No more distractions like HTML and searching for DOM elements,
just beautiful and simple Ruby code. Front-End-Ruby-ROcks!

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'opal-ferro'
```

And then execute:

    bundle

Or install it yourself:

    gem install opal-ferro

## Usage
Please see the [Ferro website](https://easydatawarehousing.github.io/ferro/)
for background information and examples.

## Versioning
Opal-Ferro follows the versioning scheme of [Opal](https://github.com/opal/opal).
The first two parts of the version number of Ferro imply compatibility
with the Opal version with that same number.
So Ferro 0.10.x should be compatible with and dependant on Opal 0.10.x.
